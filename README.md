# Mixxx 2.1+ Reloop Mixage IE controller mappings
Controller mappings for the Reloop Mixage IE DJ controller to be used in Mixxx. They should work for the non-IE version too. Most controls (~90%) are mapped including their shift version, LEDs and VU-meters are properly updated. Effect controls are still missing.
Read [here](https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=7263) how to use the mapping files in Mixxx. Make sure you copy both the XML and JS file to your controller directory.

TODO:
- Map effect controls.
- Add photos and control documentation.
