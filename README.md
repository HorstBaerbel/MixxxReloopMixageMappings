# !!! OUTDATED !!!
See [my mixxx fork](https://github.com/HorstBaerbel/mixxx/tree/reloop_mixage) and my [mixxx manuals fork](https://github.com/HorstBaerbel/manual/tree/2.3) for the most current version of the mappings.

## Reloop Mixage IE controller mappings

Controller mappings for the Reloop Mixage Interface Edition DJ controller to be used in Mixxx. They should work for the non-IE version too. All controls are mapped including shift versions, LEDs and VU-meters are properly updated. Effect controls (dry / wet + super) are available for effect rack 1 & 2.
Read [here](https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=7263) how to use the mapping files in Mixxx. Make sure you copy both the XML and JS file to your controller directory. Mixxx 2.1+ is needed.

## Audio

This controller is a MIDI and audio class compliant device so it is compatible as-is with Linux, MacOS and Windows. On windows, the manufacturer ships an ASIO low-latency driver that can be found on the manufacturer‚Äôs product page

The **MIC üé§** input can be set to different modes. To make it usable in Mixxx, set it to "SW". The **MASTER** and **PHONES** controls work directly on the audio hardware and can't be mapped in Mixxx.

## Controls

Most functions on this controller are self-explanatory and mapped in that way. The others are explained here:
