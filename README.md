# Mixxx 2.x Reloop Mixage IE controller mappings
Controller mappings for the Reloop Mixage IE DJ controller to be used in Mixxx. They should work for the non-IE version too. Not all controls are mapped, but LEDs and VU-meters are properly updated.
Make sure you copy both the XML and JS file to your controller directory.
